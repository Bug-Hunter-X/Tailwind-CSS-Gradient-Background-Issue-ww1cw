```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
  <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Gradient Background</h2>
  <p class="text-white">This is a div with a gradient background.</p>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a div with a gradient background. However, there is a potential issue: some older browsers might not support the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility. Also, the gradient might not render correctly in all browsers or devices.
